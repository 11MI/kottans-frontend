<h3>Output</h3>

| Task type  | Thing that was new for me | Thing that surprised me | Thing that I am going to use in the future| Impression |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Reading  | more details about `.gitignore files` | - | `git add .`|-|
| Video  | some commands such as `git show` | `git commit -a -m` | maybe `git commit -a -m` |-|
| Online course  |-|-|-| Actually course 'Introduction to Git and GitHub' made a good impression. A lot of commands were repeated even some of them were new for me. Shame on me :)|
