<h3>Output</h3>

| Task type  | Thing that was new for me | Thing that surprised me | Thing that I am going to use in the future| Impression |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Reading  | more details about `.gitignore files` | - | `git add .`|-|
| Video  | some commands such as `git show` | `git commit -a -m` | maybe `git commit -a -m` |-|
| Online course  |-|-|-| Actually course 'Introduction to Git and GitHub' made a good impression. A lot of commands were repeated even some of them were new for me. Shame on me :)|

| Reading  | -                         | -                       | -                                          | At first I have started reading article 'HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know' (part 1) on uk locale. I cannot say it was the luckiest translation, so after reading half of it I relised that there is also original verion on en locole and so I switched quickly to it. Again I have just readading what i know before but in different intepretation.           |
| Online course  | -                         | -                       | -                                          | So, main Linux commands have been repeated in course 'Linux Survival'. As it uses the simulated Linux terminal it was easy to consolidate theory.|
